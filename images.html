    <!-- Most images today are known as "bitmap" images or "raster" images, which are a 
     grid of pixels, with each pixel assigned a colour value. The quality and clarity of
     bitmap images are directly tied to the pixel dimensions(they are resolution dependent).
     So enlarging bitmap images beyond their original size can lead to a loss of sharpness
     and detail(which can be called, pixelation). Typical file formats for bitmaps are: jpg
     and png. Vector images, on the other hand, are made by mathematical equations and
     instructions for rendering shapes, paths and colours. They are resolution independent.
     Vector images are usually used for logos and icons. Typical file formats for vector
     images are: svg, AI(Adobe Illustrator). Think of it like, the vector image is made
     inside the html, while the bitmap image is made outside the html -->

    <!-- Ideally, we would use the image method of displaying svgs because of
     'separation of concerns'(separation of concerns is a design principle in
     which programs are organized into distinct sections, each addressing a 
     specific aspect of functionality). Simply put, we would want to separate
     our svgs from our structural html -->
